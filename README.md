# March Madness Bracket Maker

## Background
The NCAA March Madness tournament is notorious for having game outcomes which are almost impossible to predict because underdog teams beat the favorites.
However, there are statistics about each team in the tournament which can be used to predict the winner of a game and thus create a bracket.
